## GAMEPLAY:

Core tenet:
"It's satisfying and fun to clear through enemies"


## Variability:
Ensure that there is *variability* in gameplay:
- stuff to chase after (eg. powerups, money, xp)
- things to do OTHER than killing enemies
- powerups that temporarily change/augment abilities
    - EG: powerup: the next time you use Q, dash to the cursor
    - EG: powerup: the next ability you cast, make an explosion
- (other micro-objectives per champ, like katarina daggers)



## Ability-feel:
It feels super nice when abilities *synergize*, and work together.  
(Especially when hardcoded!)  
EXAMPLE-1, yasuo E+Q combo.  This is hardcoded, and feels great  
--->  
Also, adding buffering/ergonomics to abilities is great.  
EXAMPLE-2, Alistair W+Q buffering. Feels extremely ergonomic  
EXAMPLE-3, Illaoi W buffering  



## Delaying is important.
Not being able to clear through waves of enemies early is a *GOOD* thing.
If the player clears every wave, the game becomes a lot more boring.
