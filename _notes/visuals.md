# Visuals:


- Play to strengths: Do A LOT of procedural-animations

For example, for sword-slash, DONT have a pixelart-animation!!
sword-slash animation should be procedural!!
Then, we can determine
- slash-duration
- slash-direction (-1 or 1)
- slash-size
- slash-direction
- scaleX, scaleY
- (color, etc)


Blob-animations, should be procedural too.


Particles too ofc.
