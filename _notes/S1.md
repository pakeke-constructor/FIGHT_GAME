## SPRINT1:

### OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE:
CREATE AN MVP AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

----------


TODO: Do some thinking;
we need to think a bit more about whether to implicitly add systems or not.
Maybe something like `fg.registerSystem` or something...?

- also need to think more about inter-system communication;
specifically, camera <--> draw system! 
And lights-system; we wanna expose an API, AND we wanna have a system...
hmmm...


- Create drawSystem

- Create camera system

- Create top-down-control system

- Create ability system

- Create Dash system


Pull in assets from itch.io
- find what assets we actually need to create
- find an artist who can commit to the project



create basic menu (play-button)

Create basic ingame-shell where you can slash at enemies
